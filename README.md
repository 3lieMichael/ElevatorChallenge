#Elevator Simulation
This is a simple console application that simulates the operation of an elevator system. Users can input the number of elevators, the maximum floor number, and the maximum capacity for each elevator. The program then simulates the arrival of passengers and their selection of a destination floor, and dispatches the nearest available elevator to transport them.

##Features
The program features several key components, including:

**ElevatorSystem:** This class represents the elevator system itself, including the number of elevators, the maximum floor number, and the maximum capacity. It also contains methods for dispatching the nearest available elevator and displaying the status of all elevators.
**Elevator:** This class represents an individual elevator, including its current floor, destination floor, capacity, and the number of passengers inside.
**ElevatorSimulation:** This class contains methods for simulating the arrival of passengers and their selection of a destination floor, as well as the dispatching of the nearest available elevator.

##Usage
To use the program, simply run the ElevatorSimulation class and follow the prompts to enter the number of elevators, the maximum floor number, and the maximum capacity. The program will then simulate the arrival of passengers and their selection of a destination floor. It will dispatch the nearest available elevator to transport them and display the status of all elevators at each step of the process.

##Conclusion
This elevator simulation program is a simple but effective example of how object-oriented programming principles can be applied to real-world scenarios. By modeling the system as a set of objects and simulating their behavior, it provides a way to test and refine the system design before implementing it in the real world.
